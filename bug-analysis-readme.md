# 🐛 Development Bugs Analysis Project

A comprehensive Python-based project for analyzing software development bugs, generating insights, and visualizing defect patterns. This project demonstrates data analysis skills using real-world bug tracking scenarios.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project analyzes bug data from software development projects to:
- Track bug trends over time
- Identify problem areas and modules
- Analyze team performance
- Calculate resolution metrics
- Provide actionable insights for development teams

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Comprehensive Bug Dataset**: 150+ sample bugs with realistic attributes
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: By priority, type, module, environment, and team
- **Time-based Tracking**: Monthly trends of reported vs resolved bugs
- **Performance Metrics**: Resolution time analysis by priority level
- **Team Performance**: Track team-wise bug resolution rates
- **Critical Insights**: Automated recommendations for bug prioritization

## 📊 Metrics Analyzed

1. **Overall Statistics**
   - Total bugs reported
   - Resolution rate
   - Average severity score
   - Average resolution time

2. **Bug Distribution**
   - By Priority (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - By Type (Functional, UI/UX, Performance, Security, etc.)
   - By Module (Dashboard, API Gateway, Login, etc.)
   - By Environment (Production, Staging, Development, QA)

3. **Resolution Analysis**
   - Time to resolve by priority
   - Team performance metrics
   - Monthly reporting trends

4. **Critical Insights**
   - High-severity bug count
   - Open critical bugs
   - Slowest resolution areas
   - Most problematic environments

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: Numerical operations
- **datetime**: Time-based calculations
